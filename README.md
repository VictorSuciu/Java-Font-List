# Java-Font-List

[**Download Here**](https://github.com/VictorSuciu/README-Assets/tree/master/Java-Font-List/Downloads)

## Overview

This is a utility that displays all available fonts for the version of 
Java on your machine. I created it to make choosing fonts for a Java project 
that  less of a hastle. Unlike common search results on Google that only 
list font names, this utility lists each font name in its own font so you can 
see what each one actually looks like.

## Due Credit

The code that gets the names of all system fonts was written by **Alvin Alexander** 
on this [blog post](https://alvinalexander.com/blog/post/jfc-swing/swing-faq-list-fonts-current-platform).
This utility takes those names as type String and generates a UI for ease of use.
