## Overview

This is a utility that displays all available fonts for the version of 
Java on your machine. I created it to make choosing fonts for a Java project 
that  less of a hastle. Unlike common search results on Google that only 
list font names, this utility lists each font in its own font so you can 
see what each one actually looks like.
